I would like to become a famous ballerina, and I know that in order to do that, I must train and practice and practice, but there are some other things I would like to do in the future. I would like to help animals that need shelter, as there are many animals on the streets, and we should help them. I would also like to be a businesswoman, have a company, and generate jobs for others. I would like to take care of my family; we are from a very small town, and we moved to a larger city so my sister and I could have more job opportunities when we grew up. There are many things I dream of, but first, I must go to school and help my parents with the family business. They have a small shop, and I help them in the afternoons; that’s where I do my homework.  I’m not very happy about the job, but I’m glad to help them; I would like to be able to do more for them.","name":"60DB","hidden":false,"id":"Q2j2FqFc"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<br>Luisa.","name":"WcKM","hidden":false,"id":"MB731z7W"}],"background":"","id":"1ZxJ","block":"group","name":"YYeg"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"HhjP"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"FjmW"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"q88z"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"pqyA"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
