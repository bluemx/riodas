Por ejemplo, el uso afirmativo del “verb to be” en tiempo presente nos brinda tres opciones (am, is, are), de las cuales, sólo una será correcta. En cuanto al resto de los tiempos simples, el alumno necesita recordar las reglas gramaticales que memorizó e identificar la respuesta correcta. Los alumnos suelen olvidar las distintas reglas para conjugaciones de verbos regulares y verbos irregulares, así como la sintaxis y la ortografía (Spelling) de ciertas palabras, ya que en L1 las palabras se escriben como suenan.<br><br>    En la sección de preguntas medianas, se requiere un conocimiento más a fondo del uso del lenguaje, comprensión lectora y de análisis que va más allá del entendimiento  de palabras  y tiempos verbales simples y la capacidad de relacionar las palabras claves con sus correspondientes respuestas. En este caso, es necesario entender los distintos tiempos verbales, tanto simples como compuestos, así como el correcto uso de conectores y verbos modales (o verbos auxiliares) para ser capaz de identificar errores en oraciones y pequeños textos.<br> Esto aplica en todas las preguntas de desarrollo mediano, donde el alumno ya sabe identificar qué es lo que gramaticalmente completa mejor una idea. En algunos casos se utilizará la comprensión de idea general y en otros tantos la información de palabras claves y la habilidad de “leer entre líneas”.<br><br>  En la sección de preguntas difíciles, se requiere un conocimiento mucho más complejo del uso del lenguaje, comprensión lectora y de análisis que va más allá del entendimiento de palabras  y tiempos verbales simples y compuestos.
