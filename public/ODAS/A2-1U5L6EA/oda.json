I’m playing now against the puppies of  Springfield. My team is trying to score as many goals as possible in this game.  Today we are doing exercise, for example I’m lifting weight, running and boxing. My team for example they are running, but they are not swimming. Today I’m drinking water and eating lots of vegetables and I’m eating protein for my muscles. Tomas is drinking Energade his favorite sport drink but he isn’t eating too much protein. But he is eating low carbohydrates. I’m playing at the New Soccer Stadium. I love that place. I’m looking to score 2 goals. I’m expecting to win, and doing my best. Soccer is my life and my game and I’m trying to win today and tomorrow. I’m studying English and I’m working very hard now. I’m not giving up and I’m not wasting my time.","name":"yJvf","hidden":false,"id":"3NEoRS1i"}],"background":"","id":"pY7l","block":"group","name":"TA14"},{"marker":"","class":"my-10\n","content":[{"marker":"","class":"text-xl flex items-center my-5","content":[{"text":"1.
