We are not perfect, but we try to be there for each other. We are strong and independent, and we get along well. <br> Last year, we had a get-together right before Christmas, and we got to see cousins and third cousins we hadn’t seen in years. I know there are apps and social media we could have used to communicate, but you know how things are. It is very different to see your family in person and hug them. <br> There are two cousins, Laura and Pablo, who have always had this strange rivalry, they both play tennis and are good at it, but they don’t enjoy it that much as they are always competing against each other. In that get-together, they decided they would play tennis, and it was a catastrophic event: for some reason, when Pablo hit the ball, it was sent straight to my aunt, their mother’s face. We ended up at the hospital, and my aunt Lupita had a few stitches on her lips. <br> She was not angry, but Laura was furious. She always says that Pablo brings bad luck to the family. I think she is just jealous.  After going to the hospital, we decided to chill out and talk about our lives; we are a big family, and even though we are not that close, we know our parents and their siblings were close-knit. I hope to be like that in the future.<br> I think family is essential, and we can always go over miscommunication issues or misunderstandings with the best intention of all: unity. Blood is thicker than water, or that’s what I’ve heard.<br> What do you think?","class":"","id":"lP6n","block":"text","name":"HluR"}],"background":"","id":"wgec","block":"group","name":"yV9R"},{"marker":"","class":"grid gap-2 m-5 p-5 bg-yellow-400 rounded text-lgshadow-xl","content":[{"text":"1.
