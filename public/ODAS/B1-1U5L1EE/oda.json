Oaxaca is an amazing region in Mexico with a rich cultural heritage.<br> <b>Cindy</b>: That sounds fascinating! What did you enjoy the most about your visit?<br> <b>Sandra</b>: There were so many things to love about Oaxaca. The first thing that comes to mind is the incredible food. Oaxaca is known for its delicious cuisine, especially its mole sauces, tlayudas, and street food like tamales and tacos.<br> <b>Cindy</b>: Yum, that sounds delicious! Did you try any traditional drinks as well?<br> <b>Sandra</b>: Absolutely! I couldn't resist trying their mezcal. Oaxaca is famous for its mezcal production, and visiting a mezcal distillery was a unique experience. The flavors were diverse and unlike anything I've tasted before.<br> <b>Cindy</b>:  Did you explore any cultural sites or attend any local events?<br> <b>Sandra</b>: Yes, I did! Oaxaca has a vibrant cultural scene. I visited the Monte AlbÃ¡n archaeological site, which was once the capital of the Zapotec civilization. The ancient ruins were awe-inspiring, and the views from the top of the pyramids were breathtaking.<br> <b>Cindy</b>: That sounds like an incredible historical journey. Were there any other cultural events or festivities you got to witness?<br> <b>Sandra</b>: Yes, I was fortunate enough to be there during the Guelaguetza festival.  It's a traditional celebration that showcases the diverse cultures of Oaxaca through music, dance, and colorful parades.  The colorful costumes and passionate performances left a lasting impression on me.  and I would love to return to explore more of its hidden gems and immerse myself deeper into its rich culture.<br> <b>Cindy</b>: I'm glad to hear that you had such a wonderful experience. <br> <b>Sandra</b>: Thank you! I can't wait to see where my next journey takes me.<br>","name":"uGzl","hidden":false,"id":"cuzP"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"0coL"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"86Si"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"YTSY"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"olSO"}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
