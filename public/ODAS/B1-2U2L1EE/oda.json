In the close-knit community, the journey of career paths <b>has been</b> an inspiring tapestry of achievements and ongoing dedication. Over the years, many <b>have achieved</b> remarkable goals. Some <b>have opened</b> thriving businesses, like the group called \"Artesanos Tejedores de Jalieza\" while others <b>have earned</b> prestigious awards for their contributions. One remarkable example of this is Crispina Navarro GÃ³mez, the craftswoman who <b>has earned</b> several prizes because of her non-stop labor. She <b>has been participating</b> in contests tirelessly since she was 17 years old, earning more than 30 awards.  The symphony of accomplishments resonates throughout our town. Communities inside our village <b>have been fostering</b> innovation, and continuously developing new products and services. These communities <b>have also become</b> educators that <b>have been imparting knowledge, and refining</b> their teaching methods through workshops and collaboration. Each person's story weaves into the collective narrative, a testament to the power of living traditions that are the essence of our community's dynamic career journey.","name":"RaMQ","hidden":false,"id":"cuzP"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"cK9d"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"iymv"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"KZAE"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"jBJ1"}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}]}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
