Esta parte del examen consta de dos tipos de ejercicios, de vocabulario y de lectura de comprensión. Los ejercicios de vocabulario evalúan la habilidad para reconocer el vocabulario básico utilizado en contextos variados. Para este tipo de ejercicios es necesario reconocer las palabras de vocabulario que se presentan y determinar cuál es la única respuesta correcta para responder alguna pregunta o completar alguna frase. En esta parte de la prueba el nivel de complejidad es un poco más elevado por lo que el vocabulario incluirá otros contextos además de vocabulario de uso diario. Hay también textos cortos en donde se tendrá que determinar el significado de algunas palabras dependiendo del contexto en que se presentan. Para responder este tipo de preguntas es necesario volver al texto y determinar cuál es el significado que se asemeje más al del texto original.   Los ejercicios de lectura miden una variedad de destrezas. Algunos ejercicios evalúan la comprensión literal de las ideas incluidas en el pasaje.En este tipo de ejercicios es necesario leer el texto completo. La respuesta se encuentra literalmente en el texto. En otros, se debe analizar el texto presentado. Es decir, se tendrá que leer el texto completo y hacer inferencias o sacar conclusiones con base a lo que se leyó.","name":"ZsIx","hidden":false,"id":""},{"file":"files/INS.mp3","wave":false,"class":"","autoplay":false,"id":"FUyV","block":"audio","name":"4fOE"}],"background":"","name":"GuZi","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-3 my-2 max-w-3xl mx-auto border-4 border-sky-900 rounded-lg ","content":[{"block":"text","class":"","text":"This part of the test has two types of exercises, vocabulary and reading comprehension.

This clean and abundant energy source has gained popularity in recent years due to growing environmental concerns and thanks to technological advancements. Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are the key components that convert sunlight into electricity.  The science behind solar energy lies in the photovoltaic effect, where sunlight excites electrons in the solar cells of panels, creating an electric current. Solar panels are composed of many individual solar cells connected together in a grid. These panels can be installed on rooftops, open fields, or even integrated into various products like solar-powered chargers and outdoor lights.  One of the major benefits of solar energy is its positive impact on the environment. Solar power produces no greenhouse gas emissions, making it a crucial tool in combating climate change. Moreover, solar panels require minimal maintenance and can last for decades, reducing the need for constant replacements.  Another advantage is the potential for energy independence. By generating their own electricity through solar panels, individuals, businesses, and even entire communities can reduce dependency on fossil fuels and conventional power grids. In some cases, excess energy generated by solar panels can be fed back into the grid, allowing users to earn credits or financial incentives from their electricity suppliers.   Despite its benefits, solar energy does face certain challenges. The efficiency of solar panels can be affected by factors like weather conditions and geographical location. Initial installation costs can also be relatively high, although they are decreasing as technology improves and adoption increases.  To sum up, solar energy offers a promising and sustainable solution to our energy needs. With its ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote energy independence, and contribute to a cleaner environment, solar power is an essential part of the global effort to transition to renewable energy sources.","class":"","id":"NpzcMrRh","block":"text","name":"u0ZZ"}],"background":"","id":"oEvAN1Ea","block":"group","name":"jfIl"}],"background":"","id":"lT81","block":"group","name":"ny8P"},{"id":"3qh2Sv2LjY7H18nQTttK","class":"","audiofiles":"","textual":" The text is aimed at \nscientists \nlawyers\nstudents\nc\n\n  Why has solar energy gained popularity?\nNatural disasters\nEconomical reasons\nEnvironmental concerns and technology\nc\n\n How does solar energy impact climate change? \nReduces greenhouse gases.\nIncreases greenhouse emissions\nCauses pollution\na\n\n What is an economical benefit of using solar panels?\nInstallation costs.\nFinancial incentives. \nAdoption increases. \nb\n\nHow is the installation cost changing?\nIncreasing\nAffordable\nSame\nb\n\nWhat is the main topic of the text? \nSolar energy as a sustainable source. \nClimate change.\nSolar panel installation. \na\n\n","counter":26,"evaluation":"","block":"elashq","name":"d0cD","hidetext":false}],"background":"","name":"fgnk","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":"3pgIhNpR"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
