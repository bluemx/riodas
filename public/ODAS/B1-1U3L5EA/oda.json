The positive feedback from my teacher has been incredibly encouraging. <b>Heâ€™s</b> told me I sing very well. So, my dream is to pursue higher education in music and turn my passion into a successful career. My friend Samantha has a deep love for traveling, and her adventurous <b>spiritâ€™s</b> taken her several cities around the country. However, <b>sheâ€™s</b> yet to explore the beauty of Europe, which has always been on her bucket list. Her dream is to travel around the world. She envisions herself as a flight attendant, a profession that perfectly aligns with her love for exploration and connecting with several people. On the other hand, our friend George <b>hasnâ€™t</b> made any decision about what to do after finishing Jr. High School. <b>Heâ€™s</b> been aware of the importance of making the right decision and believes that seeking guidance is essential. <b>Heâ€™s</b> heard about vocational guidance coaching, and he sees it as a valuable opportunity to explore various career options. The possibilities seem endless, we are excited to embrace this new chapter in our life with an open mind and determination.","name":"ITcW","hidden":false,"id":""}],"background":"","name":"bmEq","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""}],"background":"","id":"gAjK","block":"group","name":"utRB"}],"background":"","id":"MKD6","block":"group","name":"W2Jl"}],"background":"","id":"zhKT","block":"group","name":"uvaO"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
