Since she was a little girl in Oklahoma, she had watched the stars with wonder and curiosity. She had read every book, every magazine, watched every documentary, and studied every article related to space exploration. She had applied to the NASA astronaut program three times, but each time she was rejected. She had almost given up hope, until one day she received an email from a private company called SpaceTEX.<br> They were looking for volunteers for a trip mission to Saturn. They had developed a new spaceship that could carry a crew of five to that planet, but they had no guarantee of a safe return. They needed people who were willing to take the risk, who had nothing to lose, who wanted to make history to be the first ones. She was one of them.<br> She signed up without hesitation. She packed her bags and said goodbye to her family and friends. She boarded the rocket with three other brave souls, and they blasted off into the unknown. She felt a surge of adrenaline and excitement as they left the Earth behind. She looked out the window and saw the blue planet fade into a tiny dot.<br> She spent the next 3 years in a cramped capsule, sharing stories, jokes, and dreams with her crewmates. They became like a family to her. They endured the hardships of space travel, such as weightlessness, radiation, isolation, and boredom. They also enjoyed the wonders of space, such as the sight of asteroids, comets, and planets. They watched Saturn grew larger and larger in their view.<br> They finally arrived at their destination. They put on their spacesuits and prepared to land. They felt a jolt as the rocket entered the Venus’ atmosphere. They saw flames and sparks as the heat shield burned away. They heard a loud thud as the parachutes deployed. They felt another jolt as the retro-rockets fired. They touched down on the dusty surface.<br> Emma was the first one to open the hatch. She stepped out of the capsule and planted her feet on the Saturn’ soil. She looked around and saw a barren landscape of rocks and sand. She looked up and saw a pale sun, four tiny moons and the giant ring around Saturn. She felt a mix of awe and loneliness.<br> She had made it to Saturn. She had fulfilled her dream. She wrote her name in history.<br> But she knew she would never see Earth again in a very long time.<br>","class":"text-lg","id":"xmmg","block":"text","name":"iz68"}],"background":"","id":"4N55","block":"group","name":"AFza"},{"marker":"","class":"my-5 grid gap-5","content":[{"text":"Select the correct answer\t\t","class":"text-xl","id":"xmmgytQN","block":"text","name":"9kf7"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"1.","class":"text-xl bg-yellow-400 p-1 rounded mr-2","id":"slDA0Yp9","block":"text","name":"lujU"},{"text":"Type of language they use:","class":"text-xl","id":"6aONAzwm","block":"text","name":"ctoN"},{"class":"","options":[{"text":"Informal","class":"","id":"y2mI","block":"text","name":"Uih8"},{"text":"Formal","class":"","id":"F6F0PE8h","block":"text","name":"YvP6"}],"evaluation":"auto","showResult":false,"dropdown":false,"dropdownpos":"top","id":"ek1Z","block":"option","name":"E0o8"}],"background":"","id":"JZE8","block":"group","name":"OFNK"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"2.","class":"text-xl bg-yellow-400 p-1 rounded mr-2","id":"slDA0Yp98VoN","block":"text","name":"Mgk2"},{"text":"General idea:","class":"text-xl","id":"6aONAzwmumdi","block":"text","name":"4ww7"},{"class":"","options":[{"text":"to describe the adventure of a space trip","class":"","id":"y2mIRvyM","block":"text","name":"QNav"},{"text":"the life of an astronaut","class":"","id":"F6F0PE8hrNRl","block":"text","name":"A1ED"},{"text":"the view of Saturn","class":"","id":"IEyTj6iv","block":"text","name":"LJKn"}],"evaluation":"auto","showResult":false,"dropdown":false,"dropdownpos":"top","id":"ek1ZKPid","block":"option","name":"1xYJ"}],"background":"","id":"j1rnm3iH","block":"group","name":"n7bp"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"3.","class":"text-xl bg-yellow-400 p-1 rounded mr-2","id":"slDA0Yp98VoNEEqD","block":"text","name":"h5mC"},{"text":"We find:","class":"text-xl","id":"6aONAzwmumdicB8Y","block":"text","name":"7O7O"},{"class":"","options":[{"text":"general information","class":"","id":"y2mIRvyM5WZJ","block":"text","name":"FbaB"},{"text":"personal information","class":"","id":"F6F0PE8hrNRlV2HT","block":"text","name":"dYBk"},{"text":"technical information","class":"","id":"QSi9QWP2","block":"text","name":"W1x1"}],"evaluation":"auto","showResult":false,"dropdown":false,"dropdownpos":"top","id":"ek1ZKPidWrLi","block":"option","name":"V1Sg"}],"background":"","id":"e3kZVjDr","block":"group","name":"abJm"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"4.","class":"text-xl bg-yellow-400 p-1 rounded mr-2","id":"slDA0Yp98VoNEEqDw08m","block":"text","name":"QtFe"},{"text":"The first paragraph:","class":"text-xl","id":"6aONAzwmumdicB8Ywtm6","block":"text","name":"C7q8"},{"class":"","options":[{"text":"describes Emma's background","class":"","id":"y2mIRvyM5WZJB2HI","block":"text","name":"W4Me"},{"text":"describes the trip","class":"","id":"F6F0PE8hrNRlV2HTUDRj","block":"text","name":"wYoN"},{"text":"the reasons why NASA rejected her ","class":"","id":"dRWLOLWl","block":"text","name":"nACM"}],"evaluation":"auto","showResult":false,"dropdown":false,"dropdownpos":"top","id":"ek1ZKPidWrLixKXW","block":"option","name":"cBbV"}],"background":"","id":"Nlb0CRKr","block":"group","name":"EnNC"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"5.","class":"text-xl bg-yellow-400 p-1 rounded mr-2","id":"slDA0Yp98VoNEEqDw08mAKAw","block":"text","name":"f5vv"},{"text":"The conclusion describe:","class":"text-xl","id":"6aONAzwmumdicB8Ywtm6y4Ta","block":"text","name":"uSnT"},{"class":"","options":[{"text":"Emma's feelings","class":"","id":"y2mIRvyM5WZJB2HINVel","block":"text","name":"QJxw"},{"text":"Emma's background","class":"","id":"F6F0PE8hrNRlV2HTUDRjqdco","block":"text","name":"bvPs"},{"text":"Emma's first steps ","class":"","id":"8GOTF9Ub","block":"text","name":"W3qZ"}],"evaluation":"auto","showResult":false,"dropdown":false,"dropdownpos":"top","id":"ek1ZKPidWrLixKXWII3L","block":"option","name":"U3sn"}],"background":"","id":"bO5EkcgS","block":"group","name":"EVUN"}],"background":"","id":"ncx86uwI","block":"group","name":"0XBO"}],"background":"","id":"dY1c","block":"group","name":"Sy4Y"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
