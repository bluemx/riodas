It was a wonderful opportunity for me to improve my language skills and expand my vocabulary. At 9:30, I changed from words to numbers I jumped right into my math class. Tuesday, took me on a fantastic journey through time, I just love the History class I had in the afternoon. As the clock striked a quarter past eleven on Wednesday, I went and had fun in different continents and cultures, exploring the world in my Geography class. Thursday was my favorite because that's when I went to Music lessons in the evening. And, as for the weekend, Friday became a day for scientific discoveries as we did science experiments all day during class. That week, I was excited about Saturday, the 30th, because I had a Physical Education class planned. We did a family rally.","name":"fZf4","hidden":false,"id":"uOrfRf62"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"I loved it!
