It <u><b>was invented</b></u> by accident when a boy in the Netherlands was looking for a way to crisp a French fry without deep-frying. In my house, chicken nuggets, eggs, and even vegetables <u><b>are cooked</b></u> in the air fryer. We love it. Mr. van der Weij worked on a prototype for almost five years. It <u><b>was introduced</b></u> to the market in 2010 at a major consumer electronics fair in Berlin.  It combined close-range radiation and increased airflow to cook the food's surface. The air fryer <u><b>was not expected</b></u> to be that big, but it is now in most people's homes worldwide.","class":"","id":"AxZo","block":"text","name":"v9il"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"h4wB"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"OP2b"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"fLVT"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"r9vy"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
