During that time, a local tax was in place requiring a fee to be paid for \"perpetual\" burial. Some bodies for which the tax was not paid were disinterred, and someâ€”apparently those in the best conditionâ€”were stored in a nearby building. The climate of Guanajuato provides an environment which can lead to a type of natural mummification; although scientific studies later revealed that some bodies had been at least partially embalmed. By the 1900s the mummies began attracting tourists. Cemetery workers began charging people a few pesos to enter the building where bones and mummies were stored.This place was subsequently turned into a museum called El Museo de las Momias (\"The Museum of the Mummies\") in 1969. As of 2007, 59 mummies were on display, of a collection that totals 111.","class":"","id":"kLV2","block":"text","name":"7ukm"}],"background":"","id":"QnRn","block":"group","name":"Y70Y"}],"background":"","id":"rTit","block":"group","name":"nlGc"}],"background":"files/B2-1U1L6EA-IMG-02.jpg","id":"GLiU","block":"group","name":"9m8c"}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}]}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
