In this type of family, the parents raise their kids to be close and grow to love each other.  When they grow older, the family does not live apart from each other, and they know where the other members are.  When a situation arises in a family, the siblings will know firsthand what their parents' problem is.

I didn't have this growing up, so my siblings and I are not close. I mean, I haven't spoken to my cousins in years! I barely talk to my mom and wish things were different, but I cannot change the past. I was a difficult teenager, and if I had been more respectful with my parents, we could have been closer, but as I was not respectful at all, we are not close. The saddest part is that I regret it, I would love to go back and change the past, but I can't. My parents split years ago, and I haven't heard about my dad for over 15 years. Sometimes I wonder about his whereabouts. Is he still alive? Does he have a job? Is he healthy? Is he happy? Does he have another family? I have no idea, and I never will. So, if you are reading this and still have your parents, talk to them and try getting closer to them. They have their own battles and try to do their best with what they know. They are not bad people; they just didn't know how to raise us.","name":"GVTE","hidden":false,"id":"cuzPILiC"}],"background":"","id":"NGeadqnG","block":"group","name":"WXWb"}],"background":"","id":"b84I","block":"group","name":"mqeD"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"giiP"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"iLCk"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"rpPQ"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"5Ga9","hidden":false}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
