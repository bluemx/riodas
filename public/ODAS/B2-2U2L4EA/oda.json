Robot knowledge sharing</b><br> Robots work well in controlled environments, but in new situations, robots can break. This recent technology changes that, as researchers are creating a standardized way for robots to share information. This way, they will learn by trial and error using Artificial intelligence. <br><br><b>2. Generative design AI</b><br> The future is now; Artificial intelligence technology uses deep learning to generate creative assets, like videos, narratives, training data, and designs. <br> Some experts predict that by 2025, 30% of marketing messages for large organizations will be synthetically generated. The biggest concern is the use of deepfakes and fake news. <br><br><b>3. High-temperature superconductivity</b><br> Certain ceramics have zero or low electrical resistance at high temperatures compared to other superconductors. So, these superconductors can be cooled with simple liquid nitrogen. How can we use these? These materials will improve the electric power sector and reduce its environmental impact. We are still in diapers in this field, but they will become suitable for some practical use. <br><br>  These are just a few examples of how we are facing technology nowadays; we still need to figure out what's coming next. In the meantime, let's enjoy what we have today.
