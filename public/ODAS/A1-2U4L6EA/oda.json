I am writing this email to answer some of the questions about my daily routine. I am a morning person; <font color=red>I always wake up at 5:00 AM</font>. I leave my house for running 6 km, and then I return home. I take a shower at 7:00 am, and after that, <font color=orange>I go to work</font>. I frequently have a snack during lunchtime. When <font color=blue>I get home around 6:00 PM</font>, I take my dog for a walk in the park two blocks away from my house. It is difficult to control him because he is too big, but he helps me to exercise my arms. I rarely sleep late; <font color=green>I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM</font>. On weekends <font color=cyan-10>I go for a walk with my family</font>, then eat at a restaurant. As you can see, I am a person with a very calm routine, thank you for your comments.","name":"lwUk","hidden":false,"id":"fiUK"}],"background":"","id":"bJpK8DQK","block":"group","name":"wVQB"},{"marker":"","class":"mt-10","content":[{"block":"text","class":"ml-5","text":"Greetings.","name":"ScUt","hidden":false,"id":"fiUKud6O"}],"background":"","id":"gHPlOD9A","block":"group","name":"DF16"},{"marker":"","class":"ml-10","content":[{"block":"text","class":"ml-20","text":"Daniel Jackson","name":"q86H","hidden":false,"id":"fiUKud6OLi13"}],"background":"","id":"JYYvuoGH","block":"group","name":"sVS5"}],"background":"","id":"4nNN","block":"group","name":"6Pxw"},{"marker":"","class":"text-2xl mx-5 flex justify-center","content":[{"marker":"","class":"my-10","content":[{"file":"files/A2-1U2L6EA-IMG-01.jpg","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"H01R","block":"image","name":"zlGu"}],"background":"","id":"zeBpzsP4","block":"group","name":"39MQ"}],"background":"","id":"DyOM9V42","block":"group","name":"bMZk"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
