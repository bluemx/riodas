We went to the Zocalo and saw the Cathedral and the National Palace. We went to Frida Kahlo’s Museum and learned about her life and art. We saw the Teotihuacan Pyramids and climbed to the top. I took pictures of all places and posted them on my Instagram. We also ate some delicious Mexican food like tacos, enchiladas, and pozole. We drank horchata. Too bad I didn’t buy gifts because I didn’t have enough money.
