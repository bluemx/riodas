During the past month, I was able to collaborate with the government, so my <b>obligations</b> as a teenager evolved. Honestly, I just wanted to make sure that studying <b>Law</b> was the best option for me in the future. How <b>should</b> we know so much about ourselves being so young? How <b>should</b> we make these big decisions knowing so little? I <b>must</b> say, pretending to be a professional in the field of your choice, helps. Having a greater level of <b>responsibility</b> on a daily basis was crucial. I understood different <b>aspects</b> of <b>regulations</b> I have heard about before and the reasons behind them. I saw how police officers <b>must</b> behave when a crime has been committed. From that, I learned that I <b>shouldn't</b> pay attention exclusively to what I consider they do wrong. In general, the Justice Department  is complex and we <b>have to</b> be more patient with the processes they are part of because it is not that simple to know what is <b>fair</b>. I promise, we <b>shouldn't</b> take sides while listening to a person; there are always at least two sides to every story. Were you <b>aware</b> of everything I am telling you? I am interested in hearing what you think about it. Either way, I am glad I am finally back to my regular life. I surely <b>have to</b> think more about the future, but I do not need to make any final decisions now.
