A recent study shows that it depends on the age, education, socialization, and position of the person in the company. For example, 68% of senior managers are more interested in <b>private healthcare</b> than a higher salary. However, a majority of employees under 32 would prefer more money, <b>extra days of paid holidays</b>.<Br> More and more companies in Mexico are operating flexible systems where staff choose their own benefits. At Fresenius International Company, each full-time member of staff receives $18,000.00 a year, which they can spend on a number of things, nevertheless, employee benefits include a vast list of advantages, such as: <b>private healthcare, childcare vouchers</b> to help pay for their children's pre-school costs, or <b>gym memberships</b> for those who love sport. Even women may receive 4 months of <b>maternity leave</b> to care for their newborn babies.<br> Pascual Cruz, the Managing Director of Belfast, a Guadalajara-based company, says most people in his company are young, and they are not interested in <b>pension schemes</b>. Employees usually stay only for three years, so pensions are a waste of money. What his staff often prefer is <b>company mobile,  gym memberships</b>, and <b>extra paid holiday</b>.
