I live in New Zealand. I usually wake up at 9:00 a.m. I make myself breakfast and decide what I want to do that day. Usually, I drive into town and meet my friends and then we drive to the beach and go for a walk for a few hours. After that, we would drive to a cafe and have lunch. Then, I spend time with my mother. Usually I spend some time in my room, maybe doing university work or listening to music. Then, as a family, we usually watch some TV. Most days we eat at home, mom cooks dinner.

I’m sixteen years old. I live in Paris. I usually wake up early around 6.30, if I have school. First thing after I wake up, I check my Instagram and my emails.  Then, I make my breakfast, often smoothies or fruits and tea, sometimes French baguette with butter, so delicious! I usually run for 45 minutes in the morning. During the weekends, we often invite friends for lunch or dinner or barbecue at home, and have a really good time together. Some other things I do during the weekends are going to a museum or a library.  We love culture! I can spend 5 hours in a museum, which I know is way too long.","class":"","id":"lscTL4yZSy9qIFaMHPBh","block":"text","name":"cgUP"}],"background":"","id":"hpzMZN0Z","block":"group","name":"3PBn"},{"marker":"","class":"my-10 text-xl","content":[{"text":"So, what’s your day like?","class":"","id":"lscTL4yZSy9qIFaMHPBhEVaV","block":"text","name":"XjlT"}],"background":"","id":"0taFuM0F","block":"group","name":"fuiE"}],"background":"","id":"OOgf","block":"group","name":"UFx7"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}},"attempts":0}
