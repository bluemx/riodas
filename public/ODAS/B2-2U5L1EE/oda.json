Let me tell you a story about miscommunication and how it affects people's relationships. My parents always had communication problems, my mom would ask my dad to pick us up from school and we would have been there waiting for hours because he thought my mom was picking us up. One time was catastrophic, as my sister had her ballet recital right after school. My mom asked my dad to bring her ballet costume to school so she would change her clothes at the theatre. The theatre was three blocks away from the school. My dad forgot it at home and went to pick my sister up from school. She was already nervous because of the recital, so she burst into tears when she looked into my dad's truck and didn't see her costume. My sister told my dad she hated him; he got furious at her and my mom because he didn't get a reminder. But come on, we didn't have cell phones back then! My parents ended up divorced, and I can only think of how things could have gone differently if they had decided to sit down and talk or if they had seen a therapist together. I bet that if they had had better communication, we would have gone to therapy for so many years.","name":"p25D","hidden":false,"id":"cuzPKEHw"}],"background":"","id":"Pc5EgzZ1","block":"group","name":"YeGY"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"u5zv"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"Px4Y"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"hrwW"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"Uhvn","hidden":false}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}]}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
