It is our responsibility to ensure that animals are treated with dignity, respect, and kindness.  Every living being has the right to live free from suffering and cruelty. Animals are creatures capable of feeling pain, fear, and happiness, just like humans. We cannot ignore their suffering any longer. It's time to stand up and advocate for their rights.  One of the most urgent issues is the handling of animals in industries such as factory farming, where they are subjected to appalling conditions and inhumane practices. It's a simple reminder that we must reconsider our choices as consumers. By supporting cruelty-free products and adopting a plant-based diet, we can reduce the demand for such practices.  Additionally, the issue of animal testing in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries remains a concern. Countless animals endure painful experiments for the sake of human convenience. Alternatives to animal testing are available and should be adopted to spare animals the unnecessary pain.  The entertainment industry also raises questions about the exploitation of animals in circuses, zoos, and other forms of entertainment. Fortunately, many countries are banning such practices, recognizing the importance of protecting animal welfare.  Moreover, we must promote the conservation of endangered species and their habitats. Our actions directly impact the survival of these magnificent creatures, and it is our duty to ensure they thrive for future generations.  In conclusion, advocating for animal rights is not a choice but a moral obligation. As responsible global citizens, we have the power to make a difference through our choices, activism, and support for organizations working tirelessly to protect animals. Let us unite in our mission to create a world where all beings, regardless of species, can live free from suffering and cruelty.","class":"","id":"6HPU8SG23Jxd04q7kb5TACGfGvZzgN9oilCbFbkIQWv5ESj8w00bVLmnfHlU26tLtB1EFzsxfiMxtVl8r9CUtrZ9WAKF3NH5Y5exlLjTAbh7QL4MBeIC3oZdjUOhflodhplyUZb0ZLqeaNC9","block":"text","name":"Afh2"}],"background":"","id":"fc1ayyLm","block":"group","name":"8KqG","hidden":false}],"background":"","id":"aOSrCTyqjZw79BsnplJzP5FetTJSk0Dv","block":"group","name":"4CbY","hidden":false}],"background":"","id":"CsqQp0WmrlLUh09RutyAsEeAsZFEPk46","block":"group","name":"mCpG"},{"id":"3qh2Sv2LtBP2AvIwtofAGPdXoJ5h3lHkC8MD","class":"","audiofiles":"","textual":"Why did the author write this text?\nTo inform about endangered species.\nTo advocate for animal rights. \nTo promote animal industry.\nb\n\nHow does the author support his position?\nBy giving examples of how animals are exploited. \nBy giving economical reasons that support his view. \nBy addressing endangered species.\na\n\nWhat specific industries are criticized?\nThe fashion and technology industries. \nThe entertainment and broadcasting industry.\nThe cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.\nc\n\nWhat should be the role of consumers to address animal rights?\nSupporting cruelty-free products.\nStarting animal rights campaigns. \nInform other people. \na\n\nWhat does the text imply about factory farming?\nTo argue in favor of those practices. \nTo encourage consumers to buy more animal products. \nTo highlight the need for better animal handling. \nc\n\nHow does the entertainment industry impact on animal rights?\nBy developing and training animal stars. \nBy exploiting animals in circuses, zoos and other. \nBy protecting animal welfare.\nb\n\nWhat are some regulations countries have implemented?\nBanning entertainment industries practices. \nPromoting better practices in the entertainment industry. \nAcknowledging the need for better practices. \na\n\n\nHow can consumers impact on animal rights?\nWith their consumption choices.\nThey don’t impact. \nChoices do not affect animals.\na\n\n","counter":43,"evaluation":"","block":"elashq","name":"44cl","hidetext":false}],"background":"","name":"U8x2","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":"XqYQx7io"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""},"7twN":{"text":"generations.","class":"","id":"6HPU8SG23Jxd04q7kb5TACGfGvZzgN9oilCbFbkIQWv5ESj8w00bVLmnfHlU26tLtB1EFzsxfiMxtVl8r9CUKQcKZA1A","block":"text"}}}
