At 10:30, I jump into the world of numbers with Math lessons. Tuesdays are dedicated to exploring the past, as I have my History class in the afternoons. On Wednesdays at a quarter past eleven, I embark on a journey across the globe, studying different countries in Geography class. Thursdays are my favorite days because I have music lessons in the evening. The end of the week is very fun because on Fridays we do science experiments that are always very interesting. This Saturday, on the 25th, I have a special physical education class. Itâ€™s going to be amazing!
