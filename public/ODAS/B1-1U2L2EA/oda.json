He doesn't like cooking, but he loves vegetables.  A basket with lots of tomatoes promises freshness, while a <b>crisp container</b> of enough lettuce is thought to add crunch to salads and <b>wraps</b>. A <b>cluster</b> of some onions resting nearby can be a fantastic addition to salads, providing a <b>flavorful</b> and aromatic punch. The only protein you will find in his fridge lands upon a carton containing many eggs.He loves <b>hard-boiled eggs</b> as addition to salads. Plus, you don't have to be a great chef to prepare them. Finally the fridge door reveals a collection of <b>beverages</b>, including plenty of orange juice, a lot of milk,  some wine and a little water. This fridge is a collection of items awaiting <b>nourishing</b> possibilities, just don't expect to find any cooked meal\t\t","class":"","id":"Trjl","block":"text","name":"lVQf"}],"background":"","id":"02cE","block":"group","name":"vda9"}],"background":"","id":"Mha5Vv6N","block":"group","name":"Ii7R"}],"evaluation":"","id":"ZWoW","block":"switch","name":"jLbz","positive":0},{"marker":"","class":"mt-10 p-10 bg-yellow-100 rounded shadow","content":[{"text":"Copy in your notebook the next sentences and complete them using the words in bold.
