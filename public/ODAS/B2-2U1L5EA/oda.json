A creation born from the confluence of steel, fire, and boundless human ambition, the locomotive surged forth with an unrivaled spirit. George Stephenson's \"Rocket\" heralded the age of steam-powered locomotion, an era where iron horses raced along tracks, stitching nations together with their smoky breath. As the tendrils of steel spread, landscapes transformed, cities burgeoned, and a newfound sense of unity swept across the horizon. The locomotive, an emblem of progress, carried the aspirations of societies to new frontiers, igniting the furnace of industrialization and propelling humanity into an era of uncharted possibilities.","class":"","id":"oNb5fkRvrTlni6pKpWosnWmNSGJCRQlZ","block":"text","name":"yyIE"}],"background":"","id":"rYsLlJNU","block":"group","name":"XQ1M"},{"marker":"","class":"col-span-2","content":[{"file":"files/B2-2U1L2EA-IMG-04.jpg","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"gLws","block":"image","name":"OdLt"}],"background":"","id":"rYsL","block":"group","name":"JwOb"}],"background":"","id":"ZgYcxiFN","block":"group","name":"jJqA"},{"marker":"","class":"my-2 grid grid-cols-5 items-center gap-6","content":[{"marker":"","class":"col-span-2","content":[{"file":"files/B2-2U1L2EA-IMG-07.jpg","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"XfYy","block":"image","name":"ImbO"}],"background":"","id":"mh8c","block":"group","name":"ZPEE"},{"marker":"","class":"col-span-3","content":[{"text":"In the middle of human innovation, the invention of the sewing machine emerged as a finely woven thread that transformed the very fabric of our lives. Like an artisan's deft hand, the ingenuity of Elias Howe and later Isaac Singer interlaced mechanics and creativity to reshape the realms of fashion and industry. With each deft stitch, the sewing machine unraveled the constraints of time and labor, weaving a seamless narrative of efficiency and precision. As garments and textiles unfurled beneath its mechanical dance, a new era of possibilities unfurled, empowering generations of makers and creators to spin their visions into reality with an unmatched tapestry of speed and precision.","class":"","id":"oNb5fkRvrTlni6pKpWosnWmNSGJCDJlo","block":"text","name":"awAJ"}],"background":"","id":"xr9xBpRt","block":"group","name":"NYzc"}],"background":"","id":"Szr1wnYw","block":"group","name":"QEUc"},{"marker":"","class":"my-2 bg-teal-100 p-2 rounded-lg grid grid-cols-5 items-center","content":[{"marker":"","class":"col-span-3","content":[{"text":"The invention of the hot air balloon ignited the human fascination with flight. In 1783, the Montgolfier brothers fashioned a simple yet daring contraption, using heated air to lift a canvas and wood vessel into the sky. As that first balloon ascended, so too did our collective aspirations, transcending the earthly realm and marking the birth of aerial exploration. The hot air balloon not only launched adventurers skyward but also sparked scientific curiosity and artistic inspiration, forever altering our relationship with the boundless heavens. Each invention is portrayed as a symbol of change, pushing boundaries and opening up new possibilities for humanity.","class":"","id":"oNb5fkRvrTlni6pKpWosnWmNSGJCDJlogqdI","block":"text","name":"9673"}],"background":"","id":"6HoQ","block":"group","name":"LrFZ"},{"marker":"","class":"col-span-2","content":[{"file":"files/B2-2U1L2EA-IMG-06.jpg","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"dgMm","block":"image","name":"RItk"}],"background":"","id":"zTsPVU3l","block":"group","name":"HNky"}],"background":"","id":"7xJWWbYx","block":"group","name":"ehCu"}],"background":"","block":"group","name":"t5VD","marker":"","id":"Ubw0"}],"background":"","block":"group","name":"e0d3","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":"aAmkW5Q8"}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"MqIT","hidden":false}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}]}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
