Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and <b>he had come out with</b> ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, the kind of ideas that the self-educated person gains from independent reading and clings to in defiance of what anyone else had tried to tell.  The strongest one was a wrong oneâ€”namely, that the distance between Europe and the eastern shore of Asia was short, indeed, that Spain was closer to China westward than eastward. <b>Columbus hadn't abandoned</b> this conviction. And before <b>he had set out</b> to prove it by sailing west from Spain, <b>he had studied</b> his books to find out all he could about the lands that he would be visiting. From Marco Polo <b>he had learned</b> that the Indies were rich in gold, silver, pearls, jewels and spices. The Great Khan, whose empire stretched from the Arctic to the Indian Ocean, had displayed to Polo a wealth and majesty that dwarfed the splendors of the courts of Europe.","name":"nY6I","hidden":false,"id":"cuzP"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"DlA1"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"OT8n"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"OGBF"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"mdGG"}],"background":"","id":"gpo1","block":"group","name":"gpo1"},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}]}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
