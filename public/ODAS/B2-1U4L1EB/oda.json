Puerto Vallarta is splendid during this time of the year, and we celebrated Martha´s birthday. While <b>we were driving</b> there, <b>we saw</b> some dolphins jumping in the ocean, it was incredible because it was not dolphin season Jonh told us that they just come here from December to March. Susi loves sea animals, she said they were \"bottlenose dolphins\". We were all amazed by the sight therefore we decided to stop for a while to watch them. After a magnificent time by the shore, <b>Jose, Martha, Susi, and Raul played</b> beach volleyball for a few hours, <b>while I was sunbathing</b>. We all had a great time! The weather was perfect, and we had a lot of fun. Later in the evening, we built a bonfire and roasted marshmallows. As the night went on, we shared stories and laughed together. Raul <b>was playing</b> the guitar while  <b>we all sang</b> beautiful songs.We <b>were singing \"Happy Birthday\" while Martha blew out</b> birthday candles. Jose <b>took a lot of pictures as we all were having fun.</b> It was a memorable day; we all had a fantastic time at the beach.","name":"3Ovd","hidden":false,"id":""},{"marker":"","class":"font-bold mt-5","content":[{"text":"Now watch the formulas below, how would you combine them?
