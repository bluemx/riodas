I had a lovely chat with my friend Alison about my past journeys to Europe and Asia. It all started with her asking, \"Have you ever traveled to Europe?\"<br>  I replied, \"Yes, I have. I've been to France, Italy, and Spain.\" I shared with her the cities I had explored, like Paris with its iconic Eiffel Tower, the historical marvels of Rome, Florence's artistic treasures, and the lovely canals of Venice. Spain had its charm too, with the vibrant city of Barcelona.<br>  Alison was amazed, exclaiming, \"Wow, you've been to some fantastic places!\" She inquired about my travels elsewhere, and I excitedly told her about my trips to Asia. Some of my destinations were Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. We spoke about bustling streets, serene temples, and the street food.<br>  Alison was genuinely intrigued, asking me what I enjoyed the most about my journeys. I explained that at each destination I particularly loved the historical landmarks of Europe and the irresistible street food in Asia. <br>  Alison also asked about my future travel plans. I revealed my next dream, saying,! I'm planning to visit South America next year. I've always wanted to explore the Amazon rainforest and visit Machu Picchu in Peru<br>  Alison wished me well, wishing me a great time on my future travels. I thanked her and couldn't help but share my anticipation for the adventures that lie ahead.<br><br>  Until next time, Beth","class":"text-xl","id":"DD82KYiJ","block":"text","name":"Oinw"}],"background":"","id":"CHk7","block":"group","name":"d4iY"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}},"attempts":0}
