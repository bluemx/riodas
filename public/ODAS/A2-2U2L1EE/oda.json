She suffered from very painfull stomachaches at night that woulnÂ´t let her sleep. She is a very anxious woman, she worries too much about almost everything and she doesnÂ´t eat very healthy because of her job, she says. After listening to her I realized her health problems come more from her lifestyle and her anxiety. I told her, she should drink tea instead of coffee, and that she should get more rest even if this is during the day. I also told her that she shouldnÂ´t take peopleÂ´s opinions to the heart, that would bring her more calm. I advised her she should get vacation more often and also that she should find a hobby that she really enjoys and do it to clarify her mind and stop worrying about things she just shouldnÂ´t. I hope she listens to me so she can have a more calmed life","name":"OBQr","hidden":false,"id":""}],"background":"","name":"6rDI","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""}],"background":"","id":"gAjK","block":"group","name":"4OcP"}],"background":"","id":"MKD6","block":"group","name":"wY0w"}],"background":"","id":"zhKT","block":"group","name":"efE0"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
