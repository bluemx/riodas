Here, I’m focusing more on gerunds and infinitives as objects rather than subjects, generally speaking, subjects take the gerund form. When we use the infinitive as a subject, it usually sounds very formal or very emphatic, e.g. “To complete your exercise routine is very important.” However, this is much less common than just using the gerund as the subject (Completing your exercise routine is very important. Completing the routine should be your focus right now.”)","class":"","id":"7NAG","block":"text","name":"JDwC"}],"background":"","id":"YejN","block":"group","name":"47oO"}],"background":"files/PIZARRON.png","id":"uVmiGWeC","block":"group","name":"gyd0"}],"background":"","id":"rSVB","block":"group","name":"Zymt"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}},"metadata":{"sync":0.6879750571702836}}
