So it seems like this debate will keep on growing as new generations become aware of the benefits they could have.","name":"JIoL","hidden":false,"id":""}],"background":"","name":"FmDQ","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""}],"background":"","id":"gAjK","block":"group","name":"AcZC"}],"background":"","id":"MKD6","block":"group","name":"jt67"}],"background":"","id":"zhKT","block":"group","name":"1Ouy"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
