I <b>asked</b> the locals for recommendations on the best spots to visit. We <b>believed</b> their advice and <b>called</b> a local tour guide to explore the town. We <b>visited</b> the main square, the History Museum and &ldquo;La Boca&rdquo; dam. We <b>liked</b> trying new foods and <b>loved</b> indulging in the local delicacies like machacado con huevo which consists of dried and shredded beef cooked with scrambled eggs. Machacado con huevo is often enjoyed for breakfast and is commonly served with tortillas, refried beans, and salsa. We <b>wore</b> the traditional clothing of the region and <b>wrote</b> about our experiences in a travel blog. We <b>took</b> several pictures in the town. The sound of nature of the town <b>helped</b> us forget about our worries and made us feel at peace. While others <b>worked</b> or <b>brought</b> their laptops to continue their tasks, we simply <b>enjoyed</b> the moment. We saw beautiful sunsets. We even <b>got</b> to to witness a local artist painting a beautiful landscape. However, as all good things must stop, the vacation <b>came</b> to an end. We <b>said</b> goodbye to the breathtaking views and left with unforgettable memories. We <b>bought</b> souvenirs to bring back home, including traditional crafts and unique gifts. As time <b>passed</b>, we <b>got</b> back to our daily routine, but Santiago Nuevo Le&oacute;n always <b>held</b> a special place in our hearts.","name":"3Ovd","hidden":false,"id":""},{"text":"Author: <b>Fanny0324</b>","class":"text-xs text-right text-secondary","id":"ZHnFwvPL","block":"text","name":"0Oh7"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""}],"background":"","id":"gAjK","block":"group","name":"SWc3"}],"background":"","id":"MKD6","block":"group","name":"UY5I"}],"background":"","id":"zhKT","block":"group","name":"7goo"}],"background":"","id":"Lw2v","block":"group","name":"4e3p"},{"marker":"","class":"p-5 text-center flex flex-col gap-3","content":[{"text":"Discuss the following questions with your classmates and your teacher in class:","class":"text-lg my-10 ","id":"QW1S","block":"text","name":"anUw"},{"text":"Where <b>was</b> Fanny in her favorite vacation?
