A lot of people donâ€™t know it, but elks are actually a type of deer and there is another word to refer to them which is moose. Female elks are called cows and male elks are called bulls. Elks can be very big animals, they can measure up to 1.5 meters and weigh up to 275 kilos. Baby elks can move much for 15 days after they are born so the cows do their best efforts to make sure they are hidden so no predators can see them.","class":"","id":"lglzTRAW","block":"text","name":"Qqql"}],"background":"","id":"aCoW","block":"group","name":"Qb3j"},{"marker":"","class":"bg-sky-900 mask mask-squircle p-2 flex justify-center","content":[{"file":"files/B2-1U3L2EA-IMG-elk.png","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"NmLm","block":"image","name":"qL9u"}],"background":"","id":"K9mZb58g","block":"group","name":"fwww"}],"background":"","id":"rcmDR30v","block":"group","name":"FHZU"}],"background":"","id":"3t7B","block":"group","name":"hmAd","hidden":false},{"marker":"","class":"p-5 bg-sky-100 rounded-lg my-5","content":[{"marker":"","class":"text-center my-10","content":[{"text":"AXOLOTL","class":"text-5xl font-bold","id":"lglzFjpo","block":"text","name":"2lrT"}],"background":"","id":"Jhp5J6Tb","block":"group","name":"9hG6"},{"marker":"","class":"grid grid-cols-2 gap-5","content":[{"marker":"","class":"bg-sky-900 mask mask-squircle p-2 flex justify-center","content":[{"file":"files/B2-1U3L2EA-IMG-axolot.jpg","class":"mask mask-squircle","id":"NmLmupA2","block":"image","name":"AOBc"}],"background":"","id":"K9mZb58gewtn","block":"group","name":"I89F"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"text":"One of the most interesting and cute animals in the world is the Axolotl.
