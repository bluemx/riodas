When I was <b>younger</b>, I remember being mostly active: I liked to ride my bike, skate and play basketball. I had a lot of friends and I consider I was a good student. Within time, I discovered that speaking to an audience was easy for me. The topic was not important, I just felt good about informing and entertaining people. My family and friends noticed these set of skills and helped me improved them. I studied practically during my whole life and I have not stopped. There is just so much to learn. I became a public speaker a few years back,  but I like to stay active and to do a lot of different things.
