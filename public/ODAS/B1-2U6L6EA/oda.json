Mine are not going so well. I threw a party for my sister and it  turned out to be a real chaos.   The day before the party, there was a terrible storm. The place I had rented was    terrible. The rain had  caused mud to slide down and completely covered the garden. The pool was filled with mud as well. Luckily,  I was able to find another place nearby. I sent DM to everybody to let them know the party had a new location. Or at least that's what I thought.  I had  ordered catering services in advance but I forgot to tell them about the new location. When I remembered, I called them but they told me I had  to pay an extra fee for the inconvenience. Can you believe it? Anyway, the food was there, the drinks were there but there were very few people. It turns out that I had forgotten to tell everybody about the new location. People were angry at me becasue the original place was outside the city, so many people had already gone there.  When people finally arrived, they had to rush and eat because the catering service was about to end. And then, there's the music. I forgot the speakers at home so we had to wait until the DJ I had hired arrived. What a disaster! The good thing is that my sister said she had fun and that the food was delicious.<br>I hope your vacations are going better than mine. I see you very soon!<br>Miss you, <b>(4)</b><br>Sandy <b>(5)</b>","name":"3Ovd","hidden":false,"id":""}],"background":"","id":"F10X","block":"group","name":"6083"},{"marker":"","class":"","content":[{"marker":"","class":"m-10 bg-yellow-300 p-5 rounded shadow grid gap-2 w-40","content":[{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<b>(1)</b> Date","name":"e3Ac","hidden":false,"id":"UBLd"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<b>(2)</b> Greeting","name":"49I7","hidden":false,"id":"asmVzRyG"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<b>(3)</b> Body","name":"Uz8Q","hidden":false,"id":"gjkfnV7E"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<b>(4)</b> Closing","name":"y6vQ","hidden":false,"id":"uZbqPp5F"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<b>(5)</b> Signature","name":"3U5v","hidden":false,"id":"LFbgauzS"}],"background":"","id":"NmKMIGIO","block":"group","name":"cHlM"}],"background":"","id":"xqhG","block":"group","name":"D5kZ"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
