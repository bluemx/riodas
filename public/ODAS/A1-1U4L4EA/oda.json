I am from Colima  but I live in Monterrey.  It is a large city in the state of Nuevo León. It has more than 5 thousand people living there. There are a lot of buildings of industries and companies. For that reason, there is a lot of pollution and traffic. There are also a lot of big and beautiful houses and several apartment buildings.

It is in the north side of the city. It’s wonderful to live there. All of the houses have a small garage and some of them have a flower garden. Most of my neighbors are my friends. We always take a walk with our pets in the park. My school is near my house. I can walk in 10 minutes. It’s very safe because the police station is across  the school and the hospital is behind it. However, the library is quite far.  It takes around 10 minutes to arrive there, by car.

We like going to sail small boats in the artificial river or attend an art exhibition in Cineteca Conarte. There is also a space to ride a bike and go skating.  On Saturdays, many people love going to the stadium to watch Tigres o Rayados' games. I prefer going to baseball games. Sultanes de Monterrey play from Tuesday to Sunday after 7:00pm. I think I’m lucky to live in Monterrey. I love it!
