She is competing in the 400-meter race at the national championships. She is feeling the burn in her legs and lungs, but she is not giving up. She is determined to win the gold medal. She is approaching the final turn. She is looking at the scoreboard. She is seeing her name in second place, behind her rival, Lisa Keen. She is feeling a surge of adrenaline. She is thinking, “I can do this. I can beat her.” She knows she is training for this moment.  She is accelerating into the straightaway. She is closing the gap between her and Lisa. She is hearing the crowd cheering for her. All the athletes are ignoring the pain in their bodies. But she is focusing on the finish line. She is reaching for the tape. She is crossing it at the same time as Lisa. She is not sure who won. She is collapsing on the ground, exhausted. She is waiting for the official result.  She is hearing the announcer say, “Ladies and gentlemen, we have a photo finish. The winner of the 400-meter race, by one hundredth of a second, is… Anna Jones!” She is jumping up in joy. She is hugging her coach and teammates. She is crying tears of happiness. She is realizing her dream. She is the national champion.","class":"","id":"stfSNTix","block":"text","name":"sneA"}],"background":"","id":"Kx4hUf9c","block":"group","name":"Q6wv"}],"background":"","id":"hktI","block":"group","name":"IcMF"},{"marker":"","class":"bg-red-300 mask mask-circle rounded-lg p-5  w-3/4 ml-20 my-10","content":[{"marker":"","class":"mask mask-circle p-5 bg-white","content":[{"file":"files/A2-1U5L4EA-IMG.jpg","class":"mask mask-circle","id":"8PQf","block":"image","name":"vvjF"}],"background":"","id":"8fBQC8XA","block":"group","name":"cNLQ"}],"background":"","id":"xdR8JvBK","block":"group","name":"7Ydr"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}}}
