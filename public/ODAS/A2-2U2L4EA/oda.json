I can detect almost any illness of the body and the mind and I can cure all of them. I use the power of the   mind to fix people's sicknes. But I also know plenty of remedies and can advise what to do and what not to do in order for people to get better. For example: if you feel tired all the time, and feel like if you didn´t get much sleep even though you did, you should get the habit of meditation. If you suffer from constant stomachaches, that means you are holding your true feelings, and you should learn how to express and say what you think and feel. Now, if it is your feet that hurt, even when you are not walking or when you got some rest, that means you shoudn´t worry about things that are out of your control, you should just let go. When you feel overwhelmed, and maybe even depressed; you shoudn´t feed those thoughts, remember everything that exists starts in the mind, everything you see, hear, feel, taste and hear, begins only in your mind. You should think only positive things and believe me, they will all happen.\"","name":"cHow","hidden":false,"id":"cuzP"},{"block":"text","class":"","text":"<br><br>Do you think Doña Panchita´s techniques are correct? <br>Should more people go see her to heal their illnesses?","name":"WjLn","hidden":false,"id":"3A6K4273"}],"background":"","id":"eQYipp47","block":"group","name":"KtnL"}],"background":"","id":"38y0","block":"group","name":"EgDA"}],"background":"","id":"GRdQVHJl","block":"group","name":"UqW4"}],"background":"","id":"Emva","block":"group","name":"DKkK"}],"background":"","name":"4Cs6","hidden":false,"marker":"","id":""},{"symbol":"FinalizeGroup"}],"id":""}]},"end":{"buttons":{"restart":false},"content":[{"symbol":"finishedAll"}]},"symbols":{"finishedAll":{"class":"w-full","content":[{"block":"group","class":"bg-slate-100 rounded p-5 text-center w-full","content":[{"block":"text","text":"Congratulations, you finished the activity.","class":"","name":"Congra"}],"background":"","name":"CongraGroup"},{"block":"group","class":"text-center p-5","content":[{"block":"finished","name":"finishedBlock"}],"background":"","name":"finishedGroup"}],"background":"","block":"group"},"FinalizeGroup":{"block":"group","class":"text-center mt-10","content":[{"block":"button","class":"mx-auto","to":"/end","text":"Finalize","name":"FinalizeBTN"}],"background":""}},"attempts":0}
