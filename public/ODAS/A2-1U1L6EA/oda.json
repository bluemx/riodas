Historians said it came from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, people wore costumes and light bonfires to ward off ghosts. People celebrated Halloween in all the United States. On Halloween, I love to wear costumes and go trick-or-treating, Trick or treat is when you go door-to-door asking for candy by saying \"Trick or treat!\". Last holiday me and my family decorated our home with spooky decorations and carved pumpkins into jack-oâ€™-lanterns, we set up scary lights and put fake spiders and spider webs around the walls. As a family, we enjoyed spending time together. We wore costumes, I was a pirate, my sister a princess, and my little brother a vampire. We had so much fun. My dad bought lots of candies for our neighbors and friends. My mom baked cookies for us all and prepared a green punch. We played a playlist of scary music. At night we had a party with my family and my neighbors, we danced and sang songs. ","name":"3Ovd","hidden":false,"id":""},{"text":"We just had so much fun.
